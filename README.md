# Introduction
According to the dataset under consideration, we need to predict the categorical feature ‘salary’ that is categorized into two, a salary <=50k and a salary >50k. The dataset is a mixture of categorical and continuous features where other categorical features include, 'workclass', 'education', 'marital-status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'native-country'. Also, this dataset contains missing values as well as outliers which are then sorted out. Categorical features are label encoded and analysed. Various exploratory data analysis techniques and visualizations were done on the dataset.
# Dataset
The dataset used here is the Adult Income dataset consisting of 32561 observations and 14 attributes where the aim is to predict whether an employee salary exceeds 50K or not.
